Tincan / xAPI Learning Record Store in "Go"
=============================================

Currently starting with the Statement API
Refactoring and Tests will come later (looking at http://frisbyjs.com/ for a platform independent xAPI REST unit tests)

Developed because:
* Right tool for the job (fast and few system setup requirements)
* Can run on windows and linux servers or Google App Engine
* Wanted to start an Open Source Project
* Wanted to learn GO and MonogoDB
* The front end can then be written in any language

Lots of help from these resources:
* [Golang spec doc](http://golang.org/ref/spec)
* [xAPI spec doc](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md)
* [ADL's Python LRS](https://github.com/adlnet/ADL_LRS)

Other Useful Resources:
* [REST API Testing tool](http://www.getpostman.com/)
* [GO IDE for Windows](http://www.zeusedit.com/)
